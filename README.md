# Testing Prophet Library for Timeseries Prediction

## Motivation
Recent projects have required some level of timeseries prediction. The
predicted values are then used as input to various algorithms. Using a 
variety of Machine Learning (ML) techniques the actual values were within 
the uncertainty bands for approximately 50% of all use cases.

Can Prophet perform better? 

## Results
Almost 93% of the actual usage values fell within the predicted uncertainty
bands. Awesome!
